/* Code to invoke the 'astcheck' routine from an HTML form.
You'll see a _lot_ of overlap between this and 'sat_id2.cpp',
the code to do satellite checking from an HTML form,  and the
'fo_serve.cpp' code to run Find_Orb from an HTML form...
there's a lot of recycling going on.

   In setting up cgicheck on your server,  you'll need to make
sure that 'cgicheck.htm' is present,  of course,  along with a copy
of ObsCodes.html for parallax data.  You should have either mpcorb.dat
or the Lowell astorb.dat files,  or both,  present (note that the code
expects the lowercase filenames).  The results are similar with either
database of orbital elements,  except that 'astorb' gives you current
ephemeris uncertainties.
