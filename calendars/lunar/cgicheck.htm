<h1> On-line asteroid identification </h1>

<p> <a href="https://github.com/Bill-Gray/lunar">
Source code for this can be found on GitHub. </a> </p>

<p> This is an on-line version of the <a href="astcheck.htm"> <tt> astcheck
</tt> </a> program used for identifying observations with known objects.
Use the form below to find asteroids that might match the position/motion
of objects you've observed. </p>

<p> Suggested quick start:  <b>Don't panic!</b>  Copy/paste observations
for one or more objects in the large text window below, <em> or </em>
click on "Browse" to pick a file containing the astrometry.  Then click
the "find matching asteroids" button.  That will probably be all you
need. </p>

<p> The output will show each object,  and its motion in arcseconds/hour.
After that,  you'll see possible matching objects,  and their offsets in
arcseconds and their motions in arcseconds/hour.  You can set a limit for
the search radius,  and can tell the program whether to use the Minor
Planet Center's <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/MPCORB.html">
MPCORB </a> or the Lowell Observatory <a href="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.html">
ASTORB</a> orbit catalog.  The latter offers "current ephemeris uncertainty"
data.  This is not perhaps as rock-solid as it ought to be,  but can tell
you if the predicted position from the orbital elements is very,  very good,
or complete rubbish. </p>

<p> You can also show only possible matches with unnumbered objects,  useful
to those who are already pretty confident that the object isn't easily identified. </p>

<p> If you're still not getting things to work,  contact me at
